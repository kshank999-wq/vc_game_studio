/**
 * Device seats (VC Writer's activation rules, for a subscription license).

 * A seat is an installation, identified by a fingerprint the app makes on
 * first run. Reinstalling must not burn a second seat; a device that freed its
 * seat and comes back reclaims its own record; a new device takes a free seat
 * or is told plainly that both are in use and where to free one. A freed seat
 * is kept as a record, not deleted, so support can see what happened.
